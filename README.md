# airtrack

An implementation of [Air-Track](http://www.neuro-airtrack.com/) using [PyBpod](https://github.com/ckarageorgkaneen/pybpod-api/).

Airtrack was first published in the paper titled "[Air-Track: a real-world floating environment for active sensing in head-fixed mice in Journal of Neurophysiology](http://jn.physiology.org/content/116/4/1542)". The paper can also be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305343221_Air-Track_A_real-world_floating_environment_for_active_sensing_in_head-fixed_mice).

[Airtrack v1](https://github.com/ckarageorgkaneen/airtrack-v1) was developed in [Larkum Lab](https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/larkum/neurocure) by Mostafa Nashaat, Hatem Oraby, Robert Sachdev, York Winter and Matthew Larkum. Alexander Schill, an engineer at Charit√© workshop ([CWW](https://cww.charite.de/)) had a significant contribution to the design of the platform and the airtrack table.
